# hajduktools
#### Pack of several Django applications made for B2B.
[trello](https://trello.com/b/QBFqm4mD/hajduktools-doorcalc)

Project has launched after customer requests about having a tool for quick and fast doors price calculation for end-customers.
The main idea is to provide B2B customers an access to such application which will take advantage of Ajax and JSON to print all required results to the web-browser instatly without webpage refreshing.
Admin will have access to price modifications and additional calculation formulas  through CMS and be able to change them along with constantly changing product prices.
